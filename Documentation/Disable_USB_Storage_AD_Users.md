     ```
     Block USB Storage Devices
     ```

3. **Edit the GPO**:
   - Navigate to:

     ```
     Computer Configuration ‚ûî Policies ‚ûî Administrative Templates ‚ûî System ‚ûî Removable Storage Access
     ```

## üõ°Ô∏è Which Users/Computers Should Have USB Disabled?

| Who | Why |
|:---|:---|
| Regular end users (non-admins) | Prevent malware infections, data theft, and accidental leaks |
| Sensitive departments (e.g., HR, Finance) | They handle confidential data |
| Shared or kiosk computers | Prevents plugging in unauthorized or infected USBs |
| Anyone without a business need | Default to deny, only allow by exception |

‚úÖ **Admins and IT staff** might need USB, so **do not apply this policy to the Admins OU**.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- This GPO blocks **USB storage** devices but **does not block** keyboards, mice, or printers.
- Always **test** on a small group before pushing it to your whole domain.
- Consider creating a **"USB Allowed Users"** OU with **no USB block** for exceptions.
